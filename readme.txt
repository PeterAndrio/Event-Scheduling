Event Scheduling Platform.

	Use Case Scenario: User wants to arrange an event.
	
	Then, he opens a page with all possible dates and hours in which the event will take place.
	
	At last the interested audience insert their name and the hours/days they would like to attend.

	making the pages appropriate for different screens(Smartphone, Tablet or PC).
